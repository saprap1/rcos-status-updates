## Last Week's Accomplishments

> I had this idea to make a vue component for the legend in hopes to make functionality easier to implement, but I realized that I need some functions and Leaflet objects in Public.vue, so I reached out for some input on what might be the best approach. It seems like going back to editing the HTML in Public.vue for the legend might be the best bet. The legend itself was implemented a while ago, so no one is totally familiar with it, which makes my task a little trickier.
> I also added some styling to the buttons, but that's pretty meaningless until I get some sort of functionality.

## This Week's Plan

> I think I should look into Leaflet a little more to help me understand how to use the Polylines object and implement funcionality with that. I have more of a direction now, after consulting for some guidance. I'd like to commit some change to my branch, but all of my changes thus far have been experimental and, in my opinion, not worth committing.


## Anything Blocking?

> The fact the no one has really done much with the legend for a while makes things a little more difficult. Also my limited knowledge of leaflet is kind of a blocker. But over the week, I will look into more specific things that will help me make more progress.
