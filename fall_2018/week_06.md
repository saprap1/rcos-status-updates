##Last Week's Accomplishments

> I had some big issues with merging all the new changes from master into my branch. I had some files from previous versions of the Shuttle Tracker in my local shuttletracker directory and it seemed to be messing up the entire app. Tried deleting those and I ended up with a 404 error.
> I also ran into trouble trying to build the frontend again, but that was resovled at the beginning of small group today very easily. This actually ended up resolving all of my issues.

## This Week's Plan

> I had a whole plan to resolve the 404 issue, but that was all fixed when I resovled the build issue. Now I have to implement my plans for the toggle feature with Typescript. I really want to have this done by next week.


## Anything Blocking?

> Obviously I had the blocker where I couldn't even get the Shuttle Tracker running, but with that resolved I can now move forward. I think in the past, I've been more focused on some of the PRs and prioritized those over the task I have been wanting to focus on. So this week will be dedicated to making headway on it as it has been several weeks and, ideally, I should be further along. I think one more thing that's sort of blocking me in a way is working alone. I think I have a lot to learn from other people, and it would be more beneficial (and certainly more efficient) to work on this with others, though I know that there are other people working on different frontend features who I can communicate with.
