## Last Week's Accomplishments

>	Took time over the break to learn more aobut Leaflet and leaflet functions. I've tried a lot of different little things, but I still get nothing or an an uncaught reference error in the console. I thought I exhausted my options but I just found something that might be useful, so I'm going to try that next. I've also been communicating with other Shuttle Trackers to see if they have any suggestions. I am going to ditch the vue component, though, since the legend is already a leaflet object.
> For my own reference, the things I've tried: @click, v-on:click, onclick, <script> in innerHTML, moving choose() from before updateLegend() to after updateLegend(), ul class = "clicker", button, 

## This Week's Plan

> Just keep working through this issue.


## Anything Blocking?

> Still doing some research on how to make the legend communicate with outside Vue methods.
