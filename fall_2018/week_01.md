## Last Week's Accomplishments

> I worked on getting people's environments set up with Go and Postgres so that they can have the shuttle tracker running. This was my task for the past few weeks. This past week in particular was pretty slow as I was away for the majority of it.

## This Week's Plan

> This week I'm going to start working on a feature that will allow users to select which shuttle route they would like to view

## Anything Blocking?

> I'm just thinking about how maybe I can allow a user to set a certain route as a default selection. This is more of a problem for the future once I actually get the toggle feature working, but I'm going to keep this in the back of my mind.
