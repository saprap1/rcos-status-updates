##Last Week's Accomplishments

> I had a lot of trouble getting node and npm installed (it was a silly error that took me a while to figure out), but once I did I got started on reviewing the typescript PR. Additionally, I was able to get little buttons on the map legend for the shuttle routes. They don't do anything yet, but they're there for now.

## This Week's Plan

> I need to finish the typescript PR this week so that we can get it merged with Master. I am trying to balance my work on the PR and the toggle feature, jsut with more priority on the PR.
> I think what I have to do for the toggle buttons next make another method in the component for what happens onClick for the buttons. I am not sure how to style the buttons though, since CSS is not my forte, but that's the last thing I'm going to concern myself with.
> For my own reference: the areas of code that I'm looking at are in frontend.js around line 180

## Anything Blocking?

> I recently discovered (and I should have realized this before), but the legend where I intend to implement the toggle feature is actually dynamic and updates based on week/weekday routes. I don't know why I didn't realize this earlier, but this does make things a little trickier for me.
