## Last Week's Accomplishments
> I decided to go back to making the legend a Vue component. This will allow me to call functions in Public.vue within the legend, which I am unable to do with the legend Leaflet object. So I pushed a basic Vue component so that, if there is someone else who would like to pick up this issue in the future, they can start there (since I've already tried a million other ways that didn't work).

## Semester Review
> As I've said in previous updates, I learned a lot about project management over the semester. I was able to make more major contributions by helping review pull requests. I did not get as far as I wanted to with my own personal task, which was creating a toggle function for the legend so that users can just see one route or the other. While I did often spend a lot of time working on the code but not getting anywhere significant, I learned about Vue, Leaflet, and DOM. I also communicated with other members of the team to see if they had any input that might be able to help me out. So overall, the semester was a good learning experience, though I was hoping to actually accomplish more significant contributions. Next semester, I think I will try something else or start my own project so I can learn how to build a web app from the ground up. I think understanding the fundamentals is important and it's hard to do that through a project like the Shuttle Tracker that has such a massive codebase.
