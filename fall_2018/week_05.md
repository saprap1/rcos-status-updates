## Last Week's Accomplishments

> Finished reviewing the Typescript PR and that got merged into Master this past week. Other than that, I did not do much except help people prepare for the presentation that we had on Friday.

## This Week's Plan

> Work on my issue. Things have changed in the frontend due to the merged PR. This will change the way I approach the issue. I would like to get this feature running in the next two weeks.


## Anything Blocking?

> Nothing really blocking at the moment. Had some hiccups getting my branch up to date with master, but resolved those conflicts.
