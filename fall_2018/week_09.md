## Last Week's Accomplishments
> I reached out to WebTech to see if there was anything else I can contribute to while trying to work through task. I spent some time trying to help resolve a merge conflict for a PR in the github repository. Other than helping out there, I was unable to get much done with the legend. I have found a lot of suggested fixes online, but none of them quite work for what I need.

## This Week's Plan
> This week, I want to make push some actually solid changes to github, even if they're minor. I'll probably push my best bet for how to approach the legend. I'm also going to see if I can work on reviewing the ETA PR that is up on github at the moment.


## Anything Blocking?
> Just the legend is a little frustrating to deal with.
