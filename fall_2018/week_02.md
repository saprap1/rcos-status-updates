##Last Week's Accomplishments

> I reviewed a PR for updating the shedule PDFs on the app. Once again, I didn't do as much as I was hoping to get done since I had a ton of make up work and exams.

## This Week's Plan

> I'm going to continue with the toggle routes issue on GitHub, but I will likely prioritize reviewing a big frontend PR which rewrites pages in typescript that need to get done soon. I'm going to try to do a little bit of both things.

## Anything Blocking?

> I'm a little worried about the PR since typescript is something new to me and this is a pretty big PR.
