## Last Week's Accomplishments

> I fixed the issue with the apparent proxy preventing me from using npm install. This allowed me to be able to start using git again and I was able to install the Vue CLI. I created my first Vue project using the CLI and pushed it to the repo on github.


## This Week's Plan

> I'm going to get something of a basic front page up and running for the app; it will resemble a welcome page for the app. This will probably just be temporary for the sake of learning more about the ins and outs of developing a new project

## Anything Blocking?

> Nothing blocking at the moment
