## Last Week's Accomplishments

> Worked on my presentation. Set up Firebase for my prject. I decided to use the Cloud Firestore database since it's the newest fromm Firebase.


## This Week's Plan

> Improve my documentation, be able to write to the database, make the front end look way nicer for the demo in my presentation.

## Anything Blocking?

> I can't seem to write to the database in my Vue component for the form. I keep getting an error saying that the database doesn't exist, so I think I may be importing it improperly.
