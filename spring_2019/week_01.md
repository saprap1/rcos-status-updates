## Last Week's Accomplishments

> I've spent the last two weeks working on installing the Vue CLI. Whenever I run `npm install`, I get an error that says that I have bad network settings or I may be behind a proxy. I've tried multiple different things to resolve this error:
- Removing proxy and http-proxy from npm config
- Installing the CLI while connected to the VPN and over my cellular hotspot and other wifi networks
- Updating npm (same error due to `npm install` failing)
- Trying a Angular CLI (again, same error).
I have also checked my LAN settings just in case, but there wasn't anything to explain why this might be happening. I have one more guess as to why I'm unable to run `npm install`, but after that I might have to uninstall Node and reinstall it.


## This Week's Plan

> I'm going to work on resolving this issue. If I reach a dead end again, I'll start looking into making mockups for the app (so that I have a direction of what my end goal should be) as well as tutorials for developing Vue apps from the ground up and then try some new solution.

## Anything Blocking?

> Being unable to set up the Vue CLI is my only blocker. I've done some research into what to do once I'm able to get the project started, so I can move on after this.
