## Last Week's Accomplishments

> My main page will now take information and display it, which is pretty cool. It took a lot of work to figure out all the small details that could make/break the page. I learned more about how Vue components work (every time I add something new, I learn a little more about details of Vue components). Varun told me about the Material Design library that might help out with designing the front end. I'm going to look into that. I think my goals for this semester are to focus on the front end and learn a little about databases and backend, since I'm not too familiar with how to incorporate those parts yet.


## This Week's Plan

> I'm going to try out some of the Material Design labs. They have repos that I can clone and play around with. Additionally, I'm going to make the main page look a little nicer. I'm also going to do some research into databases and languages to use for the backend.

## Anything Blocking?

> No blockers.
