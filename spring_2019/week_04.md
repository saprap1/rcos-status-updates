## Last Week's Accomplishments

> Played around with some input fields for the main page. I made them in a separate Vue component. I'm not sure if that was the best idea, but it made the most sense to me. I think with more practice, I will figure out a structure that makes sense for this app. Right now, the front page has a Welcome message as well as boxes for 4 courses and checkboxes for the days of the week when the user has those courses. There are also checkboxes for the semester (though I will probably delete that in the future).


## This Week's Plan

> With spring break ahead, I don't think I'm going to get much done (I will be traveling without my laptop). However, I'm going to probably work on updating my README because that is very vague at the moment.

## Anything Blocking?

> I get some "prettier" warnings from the linter whenever I serve the app. They say that I should delete strange characters and fix some spacing, but I haven't figured out how to get around that. Right now, the app still runs just fine, but I want to figure out what I have to do to remove those warnings.
