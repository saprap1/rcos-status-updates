## Last Week's Accomplishments

> The Firebase tutorial that I was following along with is slightly out of date, so I had a hard time trying to get everything set up the way they had it. To compensate, I read through the whole thing to get a better understanding of how to implement a database in my app. It was a super long read, with lots of references, but overall pretty helpful. I learned about the differences between/the advantages and disadvantages of Realtime Database and Firestore and made a decision to use Firestore in my project. I also found a video that shows someone actually implementing Cloud Firestore into an existing view project with a structure that's almost exactly like mine, so I watched it and I'm going to follow along with those steps to use Firestore in my project.


## This Week's Plan

> This week, I want to finish most of the front end so that the app looks generally how I want it to. And I'm also going to just set up the database in my app so that it's there and it exists and then I can start working on actually storing data in it. I also want to fix up my README because right now it's just the default created by Vue.

## Anything Blocking?

> I haven't figured out how to use the Material Design library in my project, but I'm putting that on the backburner so I can actually make more progress. I'll go back to that later. It was a cool thing to learn, though.
