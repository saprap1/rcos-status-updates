## Last Week's Accomplishments

> Finished documenting the tutorials that I worked on. I created files for tutorials on Vue, Firebase, and Material Design, which were the three technologies I spent the semester learning about.


## This Week's Plan

> It's the end of the semester, but I do want to continue working on my project. I have a long way to go. I'm going to work on improving the functionality bit by bit. I want to implement a feature where you can add different numbers of classes/clubs by clicking an add button and showing more input fields for a new entry.

## Anything Blocking?

> Having some trouble pushing to Github at the moment, which is timely considering final commits are due. Though, if you're reading this, then I evidently was able to solve this blocker.
