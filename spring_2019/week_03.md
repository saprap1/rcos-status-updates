## Last Week's Accomplishments

> After creating the project, I played around with the different files to see how pieces of code interacted with each other. Then, after familiarizing myself, I started working on a component for the Welcome page. I also updated the Github repo page with more details about the project.


## This Week's Plan

> I'm going to finish adding all the input fields. I will probably make another component to handle this. I'm also going to look through more tutorials to see what else I can add for the beginning stages of this project.

## Anything Blocking?

> Nothing blocking at the moment
