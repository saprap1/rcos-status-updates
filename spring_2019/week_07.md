## Last Week's Accomplishments

> I did some labs to learn about the Material Design library. I want to use the features in my own app, so I started playing around with that. I'm also doing some research for the backend. I found a tutorial for using Vue with Firebase, so I might try that, but I've heard that Go is pretty easy to work with. But the tutorial will just help me better understand how to implement the backend.


## This Week's Plan

> Work on the Firebase/Vue tutorial and get some of the Material Design features to work with my app so my page will look better.

## Anything Blocking?

> Nothing right now
