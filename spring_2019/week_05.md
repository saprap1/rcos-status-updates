## Last Week's Accomplishments

> I am working on creating a more functional form for the main page. Having the input fields was cool to visualize the app, but I want to make sure that I can use the information from the form. So I've been reading tutorials and playing around with codepens that I've found online.


## This Week's Plan

> I want to have form that will take input and display it by the end of next week. I think I'm close to figuring out how to make it work with my project thus far.

## Anything Blocking?

> Just working on learning more about making forms in Vue.
